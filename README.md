# CPU_Design
Implementing a processor from scratch for the Ida Assembly assembly language using Logism

In this project, I explored ways to implement a proccesor design from scratch. The idea behind developing this design was to understand the key concepts behind Single-Cycle CPU Datapath design. The cpu.circ file contains my implementation of the entire CPU with components like the PC, Instruction Memory, Decode, Register File, ALU, Control and Data Memory also included.
The CPU was to be designed so as to proccess the Ida Assembly language (http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa14/projs/04/manual.html)

To open the files please install Logism (see Logism.jar) and to test instructions explore the run.circ and cpu.circ files. The test folder contains instructions in the form of .hex files that test the effectiveness of the CPU.
